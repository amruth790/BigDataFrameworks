# PySpark: DataFrames & Transformations

**File:** `pyspark_basics.py`

**Overview:**  
Basic PySpark examples showing DataFrame creation, schema, select, filter, column transformations, aggregations, union, and saving results as CSV.


# 2
# PySpark: Aggregations & Actions

**File:** `pyspark_aggregations.py`

**Overview:**  
Hands-on PySpark examples showing RDD transformations (`map`, `filter`, `flatMap`), pair-RDD operations (`reduceByKey`, `groupByKey`, `combineByKey`), and common actions (`collect`, `count`, `take`, `reduce`, `foreach`). Also demonstrates DataFrame aggregations using `groupBy().agg()` and persistence with `cache()` / `persist()`.

# 3
# Spark SQL Queries

**File**: spark_sql_queries.py

**Overview:**
Practical exploration of Spark SQL for data analysis. Covers creating Spark sessions, loading DataFrames, and registering temporary views to run SQL queries using spark.sql(). Demonstrates filtering, grouping, joining, and aggregating data through SQL syntax, along with combining SQL queries and DataFrame operations. Includes examples of saving query results for further processing or reporting.
